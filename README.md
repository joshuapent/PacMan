This is the classic game pacman! One of the oldest and best! The objective of the game in its final form is to take pacman from the starting position, and collect all of the coins littered around the arena. The catch is that while pacman searches for coins, four ghosts roam the map seeking to eliminate him! Pacman's only defense are orbs found around the map that allow for pacman to make the ghosts vulnerable for a short time and allows him to fight back. The game ends when pacman collects every last coin!



User Story/ goals for the game.

Firstly, I want to be able to control pacman effectively and smoothly accross the canvas. This will simply allow for a less frustrating and more streamlined user experience. 

I then want to ensure pacman doesn't run through walls, so I need to set up collision. This is the beggining of establishing the map as a whole, and starts to bring structure in to the design.

To introduce some level of challenge to the game, I want there to be some interaction with the ghosts that would either end the game, or take one of pacmans lives.

I want to be able to gain points by collecting coins around the map to add an end goal to the game. This will also force the user to venture closer to the ghosts, ensuring a level of danger intended by the original game.

Eventually, it would be nice to be able to have controls to restart or even pause the game. However, the main goals are to get the game functional first.

I want the overall website appearance to look better, and possibly have an old arcade theme
so its more appealing to look at. Right now, the only design added is the map of the game itself, and the name "pacman."

As a stretch, to add challenge, I would like for the ghosts to have some level of AI. This would ensure that every game is different. AI would also push my own developer skills while I learn how to properly traverse the subject.

Finally, I would like to add multiple lives, and possibly multiple levels with varying difficulty. This would add more depth to the game, and make it more lasting.
