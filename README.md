User Story

As a user, I want to be able to control pacman effectively and smoothly accross the canvas.

As a user, I want to ensure pacman doesn't run through walls, so I need to set up collision.

As a user, I want there to be some interaction with the ghosts to add a level of challenge

As a user, I want to be able to gain points by collecting coins around the map to add an end goal to the game.

As a user, it would be nice to be able to have controls to restart or even pause the game.

As a user, I want the overall website appearance to look better, and possibly have an old arcade theme
so its more appealing to look at.

As a stretch, to add challenge, I would like for the ghosts to have some level of AI. 

As a user, it would be fun to have multiple lives, so when pacman dies, he restarts until he runs out, it would
add a bit more forgiveness to the game.
